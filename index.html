            <!-- Block 1 -->
            <div class="part">
                <p>Christy Desai, Okay Humans Co-Founder,<br>
                CEO and LMFT, joined forces with the founders of <span>Drybar</span> and <span>Squeeze</span> to bring her new talk therapy concept to life.
                Boasting a combined 100+ years of launching and operating experience-driven, customer obsessed brands, the multifaceted team has their sights set on changing the way people experience retail
                across categories - and more importantly - leaving their mark on people's lives, and the world, for good.</p>

            </div>

            <!-- Block 2 -->
            <div class="part">
                <p>Christy's own experience with therapy turned into a personal mission to help other people feel
                    better, stronger, and more alive. She believes there's no reason why talking to a trained professional shouldn't
                    be as acceptable as going to the dentist, the hair salon, or seeking out a personal trainer. Okay Humans was designed to normalize seeking
                    support, to rethink the outdated therapy model, and to open up the convertion about getting to okay.
